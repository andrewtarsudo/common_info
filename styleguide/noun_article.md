## What to get done with a noun and its article?
- a/an - indefinite article;
- the - definite article;
- (-) - zero article.

### Algorithm:
1. Countable/uncountable<br>
If the noun is uncountable, it has a zero article (milk, water, advice, ...)<br>
If the noun is countable, see point 2.<br>
2. Proper/improper<br>
If the noun is proper, see the common rules for these nouns <to be continued...> (the Volga River, the Sun, the Moon, the Netherlands, the European Union, Europe, Russia, Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, ....)<br>
If the noun is not proper, see point 3.<br>
3. Singular/plural<br>
If the noun is singular, it must have some article (definite/indefinite).<br>
If the noun is plural, see point 4.<br>
4. Familar/unfamiliar<br>
If the subject is familiar to the reader, use the noun with the definite article (the).<br>
If the subject is not familiar, use one of the indefinite articles (a/an).<br>

Note: the unique subject that may have one or a small number of entities (the Def method, the Worker function, ...) is considered to be familiar.

### Exceptions:

  a noun with an ordinal has a definite article. Ex.: the 1st rule ('the first' is preferred), the 3rd option, ...<br>
- local arrangements: zero article<br>
